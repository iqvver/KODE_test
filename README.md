### `Problem Solving`
Though the process was largely smooth, it was not without it's issues. Whenever the app behaved in error (which happened plenty in develpoment) I would stop progress and try to debug from the root, starting from component mounting and following the life cylce events on the front end or from model to routes on the back end. Reading terminal errors and console error messages typically got me to the root of the problem easily. If that was not enough, Google and Stack Overflow typically yielding good results for strange errors. If all else failed, I had a few senior team members to take questions to, where I could voice my concerns and receive guidance to lead me to a solution. All in all, the parts that went poorly were just as helpful to learning as the parts that went well.
